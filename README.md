# Lox Interpreter

This is a Lox interpreter for our CS 403 class (Programming Languages). The interpreter itself is made using C# and is based on the Lox language from the book *Crafting Interpreters*. If you would like to see our work process, tests, and compilation/testing instructions please see our [project page](https://peterwzhang.github.io/Lox-Interpreter/).
